# Matchii - Freelance & Project Collaboration Platform
![logo](./screenshots/logo.png)


**Matchii** is a full-stack freelance platform developed as part of my final-year engineering project in collaboration with [Innovibe](https://innovibe.tn/), a leading tech company based in Tunisia. It is tailored to empower local freelancers and entrepreneurs by offering a modern and efficient space to connect, collaborate, and grow.

## 🌍 Context

Tunisia’s freelance market is growing rapidly, but it lacks the digital infrastructure to support quality project execution, trust-building, and payment reliability. **Matchii** aims to bridge this gap with a local-first, community-oriented platform that provides advanced tools and fair conditions for both clients and service providers.
